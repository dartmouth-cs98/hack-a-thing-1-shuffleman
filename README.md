Andrew Ogren & Scott Bohn

DESCRIPTION:

We decided to try and make a simple iPhone game using Swift 3 and SpriteKit, a tool with which we were not familiar. We followed an online tutorial
found at https://www.raywenderlich.com/145318/spritekit-swift-3-tutorial-beginners. After following this tutorial, we added our own bells and whistles
to the game, including adding a picture background, adding a new monster that takes two hits to eliminate, and displaying the current score at the 
top of the screen. 


WHO DID WHAT:

As Andrew was the only one with a Mac, he was the only one who could write and test the code, as Apple does not allow Swift to run on non-Apple
machines. As such, Scott collaborated in an over-the-shoulder way, using his laptop to look up solutions for problems, source images and sprites,
and write the documentation, as well as following along with the tutorial as we made the game. 


WHAT WE LEARNED:

We learned how to use SpriteKit, a simple game development platform for iOS devices. We also learned how to modify sprite nodes in order to add 
desired atributes. Finally, we learned that Apple Inc hates freedom, and does everything in its power to make life difficult on those who do not 
buy into their cult.


WHAT DIDN'T WORK:

As Scott uses a Windows machine, he attempted to set up a virtual machine on his computer running a Mac OS. After many hours, he got as far as getting
the Apple logo on boot of the VM, but as of the writing of this file it is still stuck on the logo. As such, Scott was stuck just helping Andrew write
the code on his.
